Tags: to-do, to do list, to-do list, list, todo, to do, assign, task, assignments, multi-author
Requires at least: 3.3
Tested up to: 3.3.1
Stable tag: 3.1.3

Integrates a customizable, multi-featured to-do list.

== Description ==

This plugin provides users with a to-do list feature.

You can configure the plugin to have private to-do lists for each user, to have all users share a to-do list, or to have a master list with individual completion of items. The shared to-do list has a variety of settings
available. You can assign to-do items to a specific user (includes a setting to email a new to-do item to the assigned user) and optionally have those items only viewable by that user. You can also assign different
permission levels using capabilities. There are also settings to show deadline and progress fields. Category support is included as well as front-end administration.

A new menu item is added to the backend to manage your list and the to-do list is also listed on a dashboard widget.

A sidebar widget is available as well as shortcode to display the to-do list items on your site.

There are two shortcodes for front-end administration of the list. Management of categories is restricted to the back-end.

Several options are available:

* **title** - default is no title.
* **type** - you can chose *list* or *table* view. Default is *list*.
* **priorities** - default is *show*. Use a blank value to hide (only applies to table view).
* **assigned** - default is *show*. Use a blank value to hide.
* **deadline** - default is *show*. Use a blank value to hide.
* **progress** - default is *show*. Use a blank value to hide.
* **addedby** - default is *show*. Use a blank value to hide.
* **date** - default is hide (0). Use 1 to show.
* **completed** - default is blank. Set to *show* to display completed items.
* **completed_title** - default is no title.
* **list_type** - default is *ol* (ordered list). Use *ul* to show an unordered list.
* **category** - default is *all*. Use the category ID to show a specific category.

Example:

Table view with the title of Upcoming Articles and showing the progress and who the item was assigned to.
